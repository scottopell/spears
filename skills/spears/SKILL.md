  spEARS (Simple Project with EARS) is a requirements-first specification
  methodology for AI agents and humans. It pairs timeless EARS requirements
  (requirements.md) with point-in-time design decision records (ADRs), an
  on-demand precise behavioral layer (Allium), and a status doc (executive.md),
  giving a clear shared understanding of how a system should work with grep-able
  traceability from requirement to test to code. Use this skill whenever the user
  mentions spEARS or EARS specs; works with a specs/ directory or files named
  requirements.md, executive.md, or adrs/; asks to write, plan, or validate
  requirements; wants to capture an architecture or design decision; or asks how
  requirements trace to tests and code — even if they don't say "spEARS" explicitly.

# spEARS: Simple Project with EARS

spEARS is a lightweight, requirements-first methodology for building software with AI
agents. Its north star: **be explicit about design, so that humans and agents share a
clear, accurate understanding of how the system should work** — and keep that
understanding honest as the code evolves.

A feature is described by four kinds of artifact, each matched to a different
relationship with time: timeless **requirements** (what, and why a user cares),
point-in-time **ADRs** (why a decision was made), an on-demand precise **Allium** spec
(how it behaves now), and an **executive** status doc (where things stand). Matching each
kind of knowledge to a medium that fits it is the whole idea — and it is why spEARS has
no always-current "design document," the one artifact that reliably goes stale. The
reasoning is the heart of the method; read [references/design-philosophy.md](references/design-philosophy.md)
once before working with spEARS in earnest.

## Core principles

1. **Requirements first.** Define what needs to exist, and why a user cares, before
   writing tests or code.
2. **Match the medium to the job.** Timeless requirements in prose; precise current
   behavior in a checkable DSL (Allium); point-in-time decisions in prose ADRs. Never
   ask a prose document to be a live mirror of running code.
3. **Immutable traceability.** Requirements get permanent IDs (`REQ-XX-###`) that thread
   through specs, tests, and code and never change.
4. **YAGNI made detectable.** Over-engineering has a precise definition here: code that
   cannot be traced back to a `REQ-ID`. That makes it something you can find, not just
   scold.
5. **Specs stay timeless; status stays separate.** Every artifact except `executive.md`
   describes a standing ideal, as if it had always been that way — no changelogs, no "we
   recently switched," no status tables.

## The artifact model

spEARS uses four kinds of artifact, each matched to a different relationship with time.
Feature specs hold their requirements, status, and (on demand) behavior; **ADRs live in
one shared, project-level chain**, because design decisions routinely cross features.

```text
specs/
├── adrs/                        # ONE shared, cross-cutting ADR chain (sibling of features)
│   ├── _TEMPLATE.md
│   ├── README.md                # index: quick-ref table + task→ADR routing + dependency graph
│   └── NNN_<slug>.md            # WHY — context, options, the call — point-in-time, frozen
└── feature-name/
    ├── requirements.md          # WHAT + user-facing why — EARS, immutable REQ-IDs, timeless
    ├── feature-name.allium      # HOW, EXACTLY — states/transitions/invariants — present tense, on demand
    └── executive.md             # WHERE ARE WE — status — the one "now" document
```

An ADR names its scope in an `Affects:` field (`REQ-TA-001`, or several), never by which
folder it sits in — every ADR shares the one `specs/adrs/` directory. The `specs/` prefix
is a recommended default, not a mandate: `docs/specs/…` or `docs/{adrs, specs/…}` are
equally fine. The one invariant is that ADRs are a *sibling* of feature specs, never
nested inside a feature.

| Document | Contains | Never contains |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `requirements.md` | EARS requirements, user-facing rationale, REQ-IDs | Status, implementation detail, decision logs |
| `adrs/*.md` | One decision: context, options weighed, the call, consequences | Timeless rule claims, Allium syntax, feature-implementation status |
| `*.allium` | Allium declarations of current behavior (normative) | Defer to Allium conventions |
| `executive.md` | Status table, brief summaries, verification coverage | Code blocks, decision logs, path-dependent narrative |

**What is normative** (the code must obey it): `requirements.md` and `.allium`. If the
code disagrees with either, something is wrong — fix the code, or, if the spec is wrong,
correct it deliberately (a real change of decision earns an ADR). Do not silently "fix" the
spec to match the code. ADRs are authoritative *history*, not a third contract; you read
them to understand intent, not to check compliance.

For the full reasoning on why each artifact has the temporal character it does, see
[references/design-philosophy.md](references/design-philosophy.md).

## When to reach for Allium

Allium is a heavier, precise tool. It is **precision-on-demand**, not required on every
feature. Reach for a `.allium` file when the feature has real behavioral complexity:

- **State machines** — multiple states with non-trivial transitions
- **Lifecycle flows** — preconditions that must hold (approve, complete, abandon)
- **Multi-step operations** — ordering matters and partial failure is possible
- **Cross-boundary contracts** — two specs interact

Skip Allium when `requirements.md` already says enough: CRUD endpoints, pure data
transformations, UI components, tools with no lifecycle. Adding Allium there is cost
without payoff. When you do write one, defer to the `allium` skill for syntax and the
`elicit` / `propagate` / `weed` workflow.

**spEARS is complete on its own.** Allium is an *optional* companion for the complex
minority of features — install it when you want formal behavioral specs and generated
tests. Everything else (requirements, ADRs, executive status, open questions, validation)
works with spEARS alone. The references note the few places that gain extra power when
Allium is present.

## The workflow: layered handoff

spEARS owns the requirements → ADR → executive markdown layer and hands off to Allium at
the behavioral-spec boundary. The `REQ-ID` is the suture running through every layer.

```text
discover ──► requirements.md (REQ-IDs, EARS, user-why) + executive.md (skeleton, all ❌)
   │
   ▼  GATE: state-machine-complex? (lifecycle / preconditions / ordering / cross-boundary)
   │
   ├─ NO  ──► implement directly against REQ-IDs, stay in spEARS
   │
   └─ YES ──► allium elicit ─► feature.allium (references the REQ-IDs)
              allium propagate ─► tests (must fail first)
              implement ─► code with // REQ-XX-### comments
              allium weed ─► .allium ↔ code divergence check
   │
   ▼
write an ADR in specs/adrs/ for any significant decision made along the way, and for
every REQ deprecation (Affects: names the REQ-IDs it touches)
   │
   ▼
validate (markdown layer) ──► executive.md status  ❌ → 🔄 → ✅
```

## Traceability in one line

Every requirement gets an immutable `REQ-XX-###` that you can grep across the whole
system: `requirements.md` defines it, `executive.md` tracks it, `.allium` references it,
ADRs cite the ones they affect, code and tests carry it in comments. One `rg REQ-RL-001`
shows you the requirement, its status, its precise behavior, the decisions behind it, and
every line of code that implements it. Details and verification commands in
[references/traceability.md](references/traceability.md).

## A few rules worth stating up front

These are the ones that, when violated, quietly corrupt the system:

- **REQ-IDs are immutable.** Never renumber, never reuse. Deprecate (don't delete), and
  back every deprecation with an ADR.
- **Status lives only in `executive.md`.** Not in requirements, not in ADRs, not in
  Allium.
- **Specs are timeless; ADRs are not.** Keep dates, "we decided," and option-weighing
  *inside* ADRs and *out of* everything else. When you resolve a question, state the
  outcome as a standing fact in the spec and let the ADR hold the deliberation.
- **Don't invent scope.** Code with no `REQ-ID` behind it is the definition of
  over-engineering here. If a capability is worth building, it is worth a requirement
  first.

Sibling skill: **allium** — the precise behavioral layer. spEARS without Allium is vague
about exact behavior; Allium without spEARS is unmoored from user need.
